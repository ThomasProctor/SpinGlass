# SpinGlass
This is a little program in Julia 0.3.7 that takes a look at some of the properties of the [Sherrington Kirkpatrick model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_glass#The_model_of_Sherrington_and_Kirkpatrick). There is a .jl file that just shows the Julia code, but I tried to explain a bit what is happening in the Jupyter notebook, which can be viewed on GitHub or in the [IPython notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ThomasProctor/SpinGlass/blob/master/SpinGlass.ipynb) if you haven't installed Jupyter/IJulia on your system.
